<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The services of Eyepto are intended to be used solely by users, natural or legal persons, who are residents, or have their seat in a country where trading virtual assets is legal and not prohibited or restricted, and countries where no special license is required.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiat-to-virtual currency and virtual currency-to-virtual currency transactions are excluded for users, natural or legal persons, who are residents, are incorporated or have its real seat in the United States.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your country of residence, statutory seat or place of incorporation, you may be restricted or prohibited to use some or all the functions of this APP. It is your responsibility to follow those rules and the laws of your country of residence and/or country from which you access this APP and services that Eyepto offers.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any kind of trading of virtual assets and virtual currencies (&ldquo;Crypto Assets&ldquo;) involves significant risk. The value of Crypto Assets has high volatility (value can increase and decrease significantly in a very short period of time and at any given moment). Such price fluctuations bring uncertainty. The value of a virtual currency and collapse in demand may be influenced by many factors, including irrational (or rational) bubbles, loss of confidence in the Crypto Assets, changes in software development, government decisions, creation of a competitive currency, technical problems, political or non-political statements, statements of influencers and news and hacker-attacks. Your Crypto Assets may be lost by losing your password or other security codes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual currencies have special risks that are not generally shared with the official currencies, because they are not issued by governments, or with commodities or goods that are tangible or registered in the official registry. Crypto Assets are intangible, decentralized, digital assets, backed by technology and trust. No central bank or other institution can take any measures to protect the value of virtual currency. Crypto Assets are an autonomous and largely unregulated system of firms and individuals issuing currencies. The risk of loss in trading, buying, selling or holding Crypto Assets can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading in Crypto Assets or any levered or derivative virtual assets is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. Be careful to keep your private keys, passwords, security codes and words for yourself and change them on a regular basis.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eyepto does not provide and will never provide any investment advice in connection with the Services.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any decision to purchase or sell virtual assets is solely your decision and we shall not be liable for any loss suffered. Please note that after you transfer the Crypto Asset to a certain wallet account such transfer cannot be revoked and we do not accept any responsibility for your actions.&nbsp;</span></li>

If a dispute arises between users, we strongly encourage users to first contact each other directly to seek a resolution. Eyepto is available for every user to submit complaints and other inquiries. We will consider reasonable requests but are not obligated to resolve a dispute between users. Eyepto also cannot force any wallet to do any transactions, because every user has the sole access to their wallet.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of a trade in the app, the exchange value will be seen when placing an order, however the user hereby explicitly agrees the final exchange value will be seen after the order shall be processed due to the time difference in transfer execution during which the value of virtual currency may change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eyepto provides you with a non-hosted and non-custodial wallet. You have control over the Crypto Assets held in your wallet. Private keys are stored directly on your device and you must have a backup copy.&nbsp;</span></li>

If you lose your recovery phrase, you will lose access to your Wallet and all the Crypto Assets it contains.
